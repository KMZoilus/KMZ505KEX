2. Updated - GTA V Mod menu AP II Intense V2, now works with EUR/USA regions on v1.27 update!<br><br>
3. Added - Hen + Loader. This will load Vortex Hen v1.7 plus the bin/payload loader at the same time! <br>
   This works GREAT with TylerModz Trainer. Just start the trainer on your pc, run this Hen+loader, then <br>
   inject any payload you want. This will also work to inject mod menus, just run this and then inject the <br>
   menu/payload.  This also takes the place of "original" and the PS4 Cheater.<br>
   If using tylerMods trainer make sure its v.1.3.41.57 or higher<br><br>
4. Removed the PS4 Cheater from exploit. It was the same thing as "Original" and as Bin/Payload loader, now<br>
   that Hen+Loader has been added there is no need to have a bin/payload loader 3 times on the same exploit. <br><br>
5. Other minor changes/tweaks here and there.<br><br>

# Arduino ESP8266 mini board version v2.0

1. Completely changed sketch. Modded version of Stooges combined with mine.
Now there is no need for any changes in ps4's network set up! Just login and 
go!<br><br>

2. ESP8266 Board specs can now be display, how much space you're using, how much is left, etc.<br><br>

3. Files can be FTP'd into the ESP in REAL time while connected to ps4. You can upload, download
 delete,  thanks to the file manager!
<br><br>

4. Configure wifi settings of ESP8266 right from the ps4 or via phone, pc etc<br><br>

5. Can work through USER GUIDE and/or browser either way or both!<br><br>

6. ALL addresses put in browser url lead to the INDEX page of the exploit! Unless
they are EXPLOIT specific pages!<br><br>

7. various minor changes here and there<br><br>

<b>ADDED:</b><br>
+ Admin panel to the main exploit/index page as a secondary way to access the ADMIN page.<br>
now it can be access via a browser on a device connected to the ESP or directly from the exploit.
(note: that some options on the ADMIN page will NOT work through the ps4 browser. Must use PC, Phone<br>
etc.  for those options to work)<br><br>
